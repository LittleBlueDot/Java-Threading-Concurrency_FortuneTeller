# Fortune Teller

In **FortuneTeller.java**, you can see a program that consults another class, **CrystalBall.java**, to get a prediction for different kinds of questions! The crystal ball takes some time to muse before giving an answer, depending on the difficulty of the question. This is where multiple threads start concurrently.

This exercise is from the **CodeAcademy**.
